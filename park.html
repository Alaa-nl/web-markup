            <h1>De Pijp Park </h1>
            <p><strong>Explore the hidden Sarphatipark!</strong>
                  Located right in the middle of the busy De Pijp district in Amsterdam,
                  the Sarphatipark is a green oasis with a pond,

                  fountain and enclosed playground. Sarphatipark is a peaceful park that
                  invites both locals and visitors to take a break from the lively city.
            <ul>
                  <li class="list-item">
                        <span class="list-item-content">
                              <h1>What is there to do?</h1>
                              <p>

                                    This small park is the perfect place to enjoy the sun, have a picnic
                                    with friends or just sit and people watch.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                    It also has a playground and a play forest.

                                    There is also a place for volleyball, basketball and table tennis.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                    There are lawns to sit on and a large pond.

                                    Swamp plants keep the water in the pond clean.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                    There are berry bushes and herbs in several places in the park.

                                    In the park is a monument to Samuel Sarphati, a Jewish doctor from the
                                    19th century whose after the park is named.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                    He did a lot of good work for Amsterdam in the 19th century.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                    The Sarphatipark is lower than the neighborhood around it.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                    That is why there is a pumping station from 1884 that keeps the park
                                    dry.
                              </p>
